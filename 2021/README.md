## Advent of Code, Dec '21

1. **Sonar Sweep**: Count increases in sequence of numbers.
2. **Dive!**: Simulate 2D movement with `forward`, `up`, and `down` commands.
3. **Binary Diagnostic**: Find most common bit indices in seq of binary strings.
4. **Giant Squid**: Simulate Bingo on multiple boards.
    - My first usage of OOP.
5. **Hydrothermal Venture**: Simulate 2D grid of overlapping line segments.
6. **Lanternfish**: Simulate exponential growth of lanternfish population.
7. **The Treachery of Whales**: Min unweighted/weighted distance from points in 1D.
    - Involved some statistical properties I wasn't familiar with.
8. **Seven Segment Search**: Logic puzzle matching wires to segments.
9. **Smoke Basin**: DFS from low points of 2D topographic map.
10. **Syntax Scoring**: Matching 4 types of left/right symbol pairs.
11. **Dumbo Octopus**: Manipulate and DFS points in 2D grid.
12. **Passage Pathing**: Count paths through graph (start to end node).
13. **Transparent Origami**: Simulate point reflections on 2D plane.
14. **Extended Polymerization**: Grow string based on pattern substitution.
    - Required solution similar to lanternfish problem (day 6).
15. **Chiton**: Find lowest-cost path through 2D grid graph.
    - Simple DP solution if only bottom/right movement allowed (works for sample).
    - Dijkstra/A* solution if all directions allowed.
16. **Packet Decoder**: Recursively decode bit stream according to given protocol.
17. **Trick Shot**: Simulate projectile motion in 2D plane. Brute-force solution.
18. **Snailfish**: Manipulate and reduce pairs of lists.
    - Used binary tree to represent arbitrarily-nested lists.
19. **Beacon Scanner**: Corroborate info given by scanners in unknown orientations.
20. **Trench Map**: Iteratively "enhance" an infinite grid of bits.
21. **Dirac Dice**: DFS across legal states in a 2P board game.
22. **Reactor Reboot**: Calculate union of overlapping 3D cuboids.
    - Went from very complex and analytical solution to a very simple one.
23. **Amphipod**: Lowest-cost search through states of Hanoi-like puzzle (Dijkstra's algorithm).
24. **ALU**: Find inputs to make the ALU have a final z-register of 0.
    - A cautionary tale to actually look at the input before rushing into a more general solution.
    - Also, reason about the scale of brute-forcing. In this case, the 9**14 model numbers would take over a year just to even enumerate.
25. **Sea Cucumber**: Another 2D grid simulation.
