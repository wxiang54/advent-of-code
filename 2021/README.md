## Advent of Code, Dec '21

1. **[Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)**: Count increases in sequence of numbers.
2. **[Dive!](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)**: Simulate 2D movement with `forward`, `up`, and `down` commands.
3. **[Binary Diagnostic](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3)**: Find most common bit indices in seq of binary strings.
4. **[Giant Squid](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)**: Simulate Bingo on multiple boards.
5. **[Hydrothermal Venture](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/5)**: Simulate 2D grid of overlapping line segments.
6. **[Lanternfish](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/6)**: Simulate exponential growth of lanternfish population.
7. **[The Treachery of Whales](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7)**: Min unweighted/weighted distance from points in 1D.
    - Involved some statistical properties I wasn't familiar with.
8. **[Seven Segment Search](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8)**: Logic puzzle matching wires to segments.
9. **[Smoke Basin](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/9)**: DFS from low points of 2D topographic map.
10. **[Syntax Scoring](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/10)**: Matching 4 types of left/right symbol pairs.
11. **[Dumbo Octopus](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/11)**: Manipulate and DFS points in 2D grid.
12. **[Passage Pathing](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/12)**: Count paths through graph (start to end node).
13. **[Transparent Origami](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13)**: Simulate point reflections on 2D plane.
14. **[Extended Polymerization](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/14)**: Grow string based on pattern substitution.
    - Required solution similar to lanternfish problem (day 6).
15. **[Chiton](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15)**: Find lowest-cost path through 2D grid graph.
    - Simple DP solution if only bottom/right movement allowed (works for sample).
    - Dijkstra/A* solution if all directions allowed.
16. **[Packet Decoder](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/16)**: Recursively decode bit stream according to given protocol.
17. **[Trick Shot](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/17)**: Simulate projectile motion in 2D plane. Brute-force solution.
18. **[Snailfish](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18)**: Manipulate and reduce pairs of lists.
    - Used binary tree to represent arbitrarily-nested lists.
19. **[Beacon Scanner](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19)**: Corroborate info given by scanners in unknown orientations.
20. **[Trench Map](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/20)**: Iteratively "enhance" an infinite grid of bits.
21. **[Dirac Dice](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/21)**: DFS across legal states in a 2P board game.
22. **[Reactor Reboot](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/22)**: Calculate union of overlapping 3D cuboids.
23. **[Amphipod](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23)**: Lowest-cost search through states of Hanoi-like puzzle (Dijkstra's algorithm).
24. **[ALU](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/24)**: Find inputs to make the ALU have a final z-register of 0.
    - A cautionary tale to actually look at the input before rushing into a more general solution.
    - Also, reason about the scale of brute-forcing. In this case, the 9**14 model numbers would take over a year just to even enumerate.
25. **[Sea Cucumber](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/25)**: Another 2D grid simulation.
